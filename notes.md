### About the challenges

I'm about to issue you your first challenge!

These challenges are for you, to help you reinforce what you are learning.

If you'd like to submit your solution, or if ever you are stuck on a challenge, head on over to the Discord. There is a channel-specific to posting solutions, and you can ask people for feedback there too ðŸ˜Š.

The early challenges aren't difficult, but they're important to do. One of the biggest issues people run into is running into tutorial hell. They watch tutorials, they understand them all, and then when they go to work on a project, they're stuck.

So even if the challenge seems simple, go and do it! It won't take you long, and it'll reinforce what you're learning.

As for submitting the challenges, once again, Discord is the best place to get feedback. There is no way to submit them directly to me. I'd love to be able to check them all, but with 10,000+ people taking this challenge, it's just not possible! Thanks for understanding ðŸ˜Š
